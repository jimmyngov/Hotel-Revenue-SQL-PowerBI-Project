# Hotel-Revenue-SQL-PowerBI-Project

## **1. Objective of Project:**
* Design a Power BI Dashboard imported from a SQL database that contains a hotel revenue dataset retrieved from https://absentdata.com/hotel_revenue_historical_full/ in order to answer the questions of the stakeholders:
  1. Is there growth in hotel revenue?
  2. Should they increase their parking lot size?
  3. What trends can be identified in the data?
  
## **2. Data Description:**
* Tables:
  * dbo.'2018$': Table consisting of hotel revenue data from 2018.
  * dbo.'2019$': Table consisting of hotel revenue data from 2019.
  * dbo.'2020$': Table consisting of hotel revenue data from 2020.
  * dbo.market_segment$: Table consisting of the value of discount as a factor to be applied in relevance to market segment.
  * dbo.meal_cost$: Table consisting of the cost value of relative meals.
  
* Fields:
  * adr: Average daily rate of hotel stay.
  * arrival_date_year: Consumer's year of arrival to hotel.
  * country: Hotel's location defined as a country code.
  * discount: Discount applied
  * hotel: Hotel type
  * Parking Percentage: Custom field created to generate percentage of guests occupying parking spaces with consideration of total booked nights. Equates to Sum(required_car_parking_spaces)/(Total Nights).  
  * required_car_parking_spaces: Parking spaces required for a stay
  * Revenue: Custom field created to generate total hotel revenue. Equates to ([stays_in_week_nights]+[stays_in_weekend_nights])*([adr]*(1-[Discount]).     
  * stays_in_weekend_nights: Amount of weekend stays
  * stays_in_week_nights: Amount of weeknight stays
  * Total Nights: Custom field created to generate total quantity of hotel night stays. Equates to Sum(stays_in_week_nights)+ Sum(stays_in_weekend_nights).
  
## **3. Project Sequence:**
A. Transfered all of the hotel revenue excel data into a local SQL database. Executed various queries on relevant fields in preparation for dashboard.
  * Use the union command to combine all selected columns: 2018, 2019, and 2020 revenue data.
  * Using the new combined table, add JOINs to the: 
    * Market Segment table on market_segment column.
    * Meal Cost table on meal column.
  
  Since it is a LEFT JOIN; all columns are maintained in the tables with the matching columns(market segment and meal tables), along with the combined table. Thus, two tables are joined with a commonality in columns and entries of matching values from the left table.

B. Imported SQL server queries to Power BI. Generated new fields through Power BI to enhance overall data visualization.

C. Designed a clear and concise visual dashboard that helps solve the stakeholderâ€™s questions. 
* The top portion of the Power BI dashboard displays total revenue, average ADR, total nights, average discount, and car spaces. Each contains a mini line chart below the data, except for total revenue. 
* The middle portion of the dashboard displays changes in revenue by reservation status date spanning from 2018-2020 using an enlarged line chart. 
* The bottom portion of the dashboard displays proportions of the total revenue between the hotel types using a donut chart with the incorporation of a pivot table that shows the two hotel type's yearly revenue, parking space, and parking percentage.

* Usage of dashboard slicer that enables the user to filter the desired country's data to be displayed on the visual dashboard.

* Usage of dashboard slicer (slider) that enables the user to filter the desired dates or span of dates to be displayed on the visual dashboard.

## **4. Findings:**

* Upon analyzing the dashboard, it is evident that there is growth in hotel revenue from 2018 to 2019, with a minor decrease in the year of 2020. The decrease in 2020 still equated to a higher total revenue than the year of 2018. The mini line charts also indicated a positive trend for average of ADR, total nights, average of discount, and required car spaces. However, taking into consideration the percentage of parking spaces occupied (2-3%), there is not enough evidence to suggest that parking lot sizes should be expanded. A trend can be identified between hotel types, where city hotels experience a spike in revenue towards the end of September, while resort hotels experience a spike in revenue around the summer months, especially in July.
